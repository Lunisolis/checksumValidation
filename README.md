# checksumValidation
The psScanner and psValidator *Software provided AS-IS*


PhoenixSec Consulting, L.L.C. provides this software, as is. Feel free to push commits if you would like to contribute to an open-source project. Building out the functionality could go a long way.

Be sure to use "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" within your virtual environment to get the required python libraries.

<span style="color: red">Step 1. 
          Setup up a venv with python 3 :: after validating the python scripts and requirements.txt files manually, you're ready to run the command above to install the required python libraries therein.

<span style="color: red">Step 2.</span>
          Run psScanner.py

<span style="color: red">Step 3. </span>
          Ensure that the output file is saved outside of the folder being scanned (preferrably in a temporary folder), and ideally the first run of this tool will generate what will be used as a baseline on your system or in your network.

<span style="color: red">Step 4. </span>
          Come back once in a while. *Frequently* And, be sure to scan the file system, rather than making the task harder than it needs to be...

<span style="color: red">Step 5. </span>
          There is no step 5. Steps 1 - 4 are cyclical; however, feel free to read the python source, and edit it to create forks if you're interested in doing do for learning purposes/personal_use/business_use.
