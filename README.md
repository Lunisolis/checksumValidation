# checksumValidation
The psScanner and psValidator *Software provided AS-IS*


PhoenixSec provides this software, as is. Feel free to push commits if you would like to contribute to an open-source project. Building out the functionality could go a long way.

Be sure to use "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" within your virtual environment to get the required python libraries.

Step 1. 
          Setup up a venv with python 3 :: after validating the python scripts and requirements.txt files manually, you're ready to run the command above to install the required python libraries therein.

Step 2.
          Run psScanner.py

Step 3. 
          Ensure that the output file is saved outside of the folder being scanned (preferrably in a temporary folder), and ideally the first run of this tool will generate what will be used as a baseline on your system or in your network.

Step 4. 
          Come back once in a while. *Frequently* And, be sure to scan the file system, rather than making the task harder than it needs to be...

Step 5. 
          There is no step 5. Steps 1 - 4 are cyclical; however, feel free to read the python source, and edit it to create forks if you're interested in doing do for learning purposes/personal_use/business_use.
